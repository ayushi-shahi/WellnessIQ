⚙️ Backend Features

User registration & login (JWT)

Password hashing (bcrypt)

CRUD routes for:

/users

/trackers

/goals

/ai/insight endpoint:

Accepts user’s latest data

Returns AI-generated insights such as:

“You’re sleeping less than your weekly average; try winding down earlier.”

“Your stress is correlating with fewer steps — consider a light walk.”

/analytics/progress endpoint:

Aggregates weekly/monthly trends from Postgres using SQLAlchemy queries

Returns data for chart visualization

🧬 AI & ML Integration

Model 1 – Wellness Recommendation Engine:

Train a simple scikit-learn regression/classification model

Inputs: sleep_hours, steps, calories, stress_level

Output: wellness_score (0–100)

Use this score to generate recommendations (“Improve sleep by 1 hr to raise score by 10%”)

Model 2 – AI Assistant Endpoint:

/ai/assistant route that connects to OpenAI API (or HuggingFace LLM)

Users can chat with the assistant:

“Suggest me a 7-day fitness plan”

“Why am I feeling tired despite sleeping 8 hours?”

Store AI responses in the ai_insights table

Model 3 – Mood Predictor (Optional Advanced ML):

Build a small ML model to predict mood_score based on user’s recent activities (sleep, steps, calories)

Update mood trends in dashboard automatically

🎨 Frontend Features

Beautiful dashboard with charts:

Daily/Weekly Sleep

Steps

Calories

Stress & Mood

Form to add new tracker data

Goal tracker (progress bars with deadlines)

AI Assistant Chat UI (like ChatGPT)

Notifications for missed goals

Light/Dark theme toggle

🔐 Security

Secure JWT auth

Password hashing using bcrypt

Role-based access (user/admin)

Validation for every route using Pydantic

☁️ DevOps & Extras
